# Coffee_Rush
A minimalistic video game created using Unity. Made in 24 hrs at GrizzHacks3 with a team of people.

The zip file is for macOS only. The code is in the other files, if you'd like to view that.

Please note that this entire project was a group effort, and not all of the code is mine. This is purely for learning purposes, and I share credit among all those involved.
